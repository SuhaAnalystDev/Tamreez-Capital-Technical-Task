# Al Rajhi Bank Stock Market Trends Analysis (2010 – 2025)

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed an interactive analytical dashboard using **Tableau** to examine the historical performance of **Al Rajhi Bank** shares over 15 years. My objective was to transform raw financial data into actionable insights, addressing key questions regarding price volatility, trading volume trends, and long-term growth patterns within the Saudi financial sector.

## Data Source & Technical Workflow

The foundation of this analysis is a comprehensive dataset sourced from **Kaggle**, containing detailed historical records of the Saudi Stock Market (Tadawul).

To ensure the integrity of the insights, I executed the following technical workflow:

* **Data Cleaning & Prep:** Processed the Kaggle dataset to handle missing values and ensure date-time consistency across 15 years of records.
* **Analysis & Transformation:** Calculated year-over-year (YoY) price changes and identified high/low cycles to visualize market momentum.
* **Visual Design in Tableau:** Leveraged Tableau’s advanced visualization capabilities to create a cohesive UI. I integrated dual-axis charts, calculated KPI fields, and interactive filters to support both macro-level trends and micro-level monthly drills.

## Key Insights & Technical Analysis

My analysis reveals a pivotal bullish shift starting in 2021, with the stock reaching an all-time high of **110.00 SR** in 2025. Despite a period of high volatility and price correction in 2022 **(-16%)**, the data from 2024 and 2025 indicate a strong phase of stabilization and recovery, closing the period at **97.50 SR**.

* **Strategic Recommendation:** Based on the positive momentum observed in the "Last 12 Months" trend, the stock shows resilience. Stakeholders should watch the high-volume support levels from past fluctuations as indicators for long-term investment positioning.

## Assumptions & Limitations

* All financial figures are denominated in Saudi Riyals (SR).
* Prices are not adjusted for stock splits or dividends to maintain comparative accuracy.
* This is a purely technical analysis and does not account for sudden macroeconomic shifts or geopolitical events.
